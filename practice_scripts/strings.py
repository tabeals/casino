#when typing strings in python sometimes you will have
#problems with words that contain apostrohes so you can use the \
#character before the apostrophe in order to tell python to ignore
#whatever comes after the apostrophe. ex.
# this is will throw an error
'I can't wait''

'I can\'t wait' #will work

#there are two ways to convert something to a string in python
str()
and `backticks`
and repr()
