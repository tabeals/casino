#any time that yo uwould like to do math you can do it in the interactive mode of the python shell
#by typing python and just writing out math equations python will act a a calculator for you
#python rounds floating point numbers so if you want the math equations that work with floating point numbers you have to write
#them iwth decimals ie. 18.0/7.0 = 2.5714285714285716  18/7 = 2
# you can use modulous to get the remainder of an equation such as 9%4 is 1
#exponents in python 6*7=42 but 8**3=512
